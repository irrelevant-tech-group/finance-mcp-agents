The total expenses during this period were $1,150, with 100% of that amount going towards software-related costs. This indicates that the company is heavily invested in software and technology, which may be a strategic priority or a necessary cost of doing business. While the report does not provide context on the specific software expenses, the high concentration in a single category is worth further investigation to ensure these costs are aligned with the company's objectives and growth plans.",
